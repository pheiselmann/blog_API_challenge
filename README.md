Blog API Challenge
==================

https://github.com/pheiselmann/blog_API_challenge

* Serves client that:
    + makes AJAX calls back to API endpoints to initially retrieve existing blog entries.
* Uses `express.Router` to route requests for `/blog-posts` to a module.
* CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations for blog posts
* Note: uses volatile, in memory storage, since we haven't studied data persistence yet in the course.
